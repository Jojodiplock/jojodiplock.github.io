                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>This project reinforced the importance of designing for safety, accessibility, and personalization in navigation tools. Through user research, I gained a deeper understanding of the challenges cyclists and travellers face when navigating unfamiliar areas. I learned that clear route customization, elevation awareness, and personalized recommendations can significantly enhance user confidence and experience. Most importantly, this project highlighted the value of user-centred design and iterative problem-solving in creating meaningful, impactful solutions.</p>
