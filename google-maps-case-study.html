          This project was derived from a problem expressed by people who are
          looking for a safer and more accessible ways of getting where they
          need to go. Where do you turn when you need to find a route through
          the busy city? What if there was a place where you could find your
          ideal path with helpful recommendations that insure your safety.

          <p>
            Safety and longing for reassurance is always on ones mind when
            traveling especially in a new area. The need for a reliable source
            to guide your path is hard to come by. Goggle maps is an app that
            over a billion people each month use the discover new places and
            navigate their way around. There are still opportunities for it to
            evolve and enhance the user experience within the realm of safety
            and bikers convenience.

          <p>
            Enhance users happiness and loyalty when using Google Maps. Improve
            navigation accuracy, location tracking, and personalized route
            recommendations, ensuring a safer, more efficient experience.
            Prioritize the needs of cyclists by incorporating bike lanes,
            topographical maps, and safer route options. Add personalized place
            recommendations according to users searches.

          <h3>Dangerous bike routes</h3>
          <p>
            It can be unclear if a bike route is shared with cars or separate
            from the roads. It can be an unexpected and unsafe surprise when a
            user is told to go down a gravel road without the right bike.
            Choosing the right route becomes a chore to the users as they
            examine their entire route.

          <h3>Unexpected bike routes</h3>
          <p>
            Capturing hills and valleys on a make is hard when there is no
            elevation markers along the way. How steep a hill is can determine
            wether or not a route will be chosen.

          <h3>Lack of personalized customization</h3>
          <p>
            Being shown the same locations and recommendations with no change
            can be boring. Without change there is no need to go on to google
            maps.

          <p>
            There is an abundance of information and reviews about places on
            google maps but users express that Google maps always shows them big
            box stores as apposed to a more personalized algorithm.

      <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
      <h3>Provide Comfort</h3>
      <p>
        There is an opportunity to create safe positive experience for people
        using google maps. People deserve to travel and ride there bike on safe
        accessible routes. Having access to a personalized algorithm on google
        maps will open the doors to meaningful experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <p>
        After conducting interviews I organized users responses using an
        affinity map and feature prioritization to identify main themes such as
        pain points that I should focus on.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project reinforced the importance of designing for safety,
          accessibility, and personalization in navigation tools. Through user
          research, I gained a deeper understanding of the challenges cyclists
          and travellers face when navigating unfamiliar areas. I learned that
          clear route customization, elevation awareness, and personalized
          recommendations can significantly enhance user confidence and
          experience. Most importantly, this project highlighted the value of
          user-centred design and iterative problem-solving in creating
          meaningful, impactful solutions.
